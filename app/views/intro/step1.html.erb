<h1 class="intro">Welcome to Thingspotter!</h1>

<p>Thingspotter is a <i>social product sharing service</i> that helps you find, collect, organize, and share your favorite products. You spot products and follow people whose spots you like. Like Twitter, but for physical things.</p>

<p>Thingspotter has been developed from scratch, with a huge portion of web love, by Tom and Paulina S&ouml;derlund. It is currently in Beta.</p>
